# Data Preparation Report

## Overview
This report documents the data preparation process for the Frog Call Classification project.

## Methods

### 1. Data Collection
- Source: Audio files from Supabase storage
- Initial feature extraction pipeline established
- Successfully tested with sample files

### 2. Audio Processing Pipeline
- [ ] Audio normalization
- [ ] Augmentation techniques
- [ ] Spectrogram generation
- [ ] Train/Val/Test split

### 3. Directory Structure
```
/data/
  ├── processed/    # Normalized audio clips
  ├── augmented/   # Balanced dataset with augmentations
  └── spectrograms/# Feature representations
```

## Current Status
- Initial feature extraction pipeline tested successfully
- Directory structure established
- Basic feature analysis implemented

## Issues and Challenges
- TBD during processing

## Next Steps
1. Implement audio normalization pipeline
2. Create data augmentation functions
3. Generate and save spectrograms
4. Create train/val/test splits
5. Generate final metadata files

## Notes for Modeling Team
TBD as we progress through the preparation phase
